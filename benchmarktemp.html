 CZ0118.The horizontal coordinates were established by classical geodetic methods
 CZ0118.and adjusted by the National Geodetic Survey in August 1993.
 CZ0118.
 CZ0118.The NAVD 88 height was computed by applying the VERTCON shift value to
 CZ0118.the NGVD 29 height (displayed under SUPERSEDED SURVEY CONTROL.)
 CZ0118
 CZ0118.Significant digits in the geoid height do not necessarily reflect accuracy.

 CZ0118
 CZ0118'DESCRIBED BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1962 (HWK)
 CZ0118'THE STATION IS ABOUT 16 MILES NORTH OF TUCSON, 5-1/2 MILES
 CZ0118'SOUTH OF ORACLE JUNCTION, ABOUT 1/2 MILE EAST OF BIG WASH
 CZ0118'AND ON THE SUMMIT OF A LOW HILL 0.1 MILE WEST OF U.S. HIGHWAY
 CZ0118'80.
 CZ0118'
 CZ0118'TO REACH THE STATION FROM THE SOUTHEAST ENTRANCE TO THE
 CZ0118'EVERGREEN CEMETERY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TUCSON, DRIVE NORTH
 CZ0118'ON U.S. HIGHWAY 80 FOR 15.1 MILES TO A MACADAM SURFACED
 CZ0118'SIDE ROAD ON THE LEFT AND THE AZIMUTH MARK.  TURN LEFT, CROSS
 CZ0118'A CATTLE GUARD, THENCE TURN LEFT AGAIN AND DRIVE SOUTH ON
 CZ0118'DIM TRACKS FOR 0.3 MILE TO THE SUMMIT OF A LOW HILL AND THE
 CZ0118'STATION.
 CZ0118'
 CZ0118'SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND STATION MARKS ARE STANDARD DISKS
 CZ0118'STAMPED ORO 1962.  THE UNDERGROUND-STATION MARK IS SET IN
 CZ0118'THE TOP OF A MASS OF CONCRETE 40 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE
 CZ0118'OF THE GROUND.  THE SURFACE-STATION MARK IS SET IN THE TOP
 CZ0118'OF A CYLINDRICAL CONCRETE MONUMENT, 12 INCHES IN DIAMETER,

 CZ0118'IS SET IN THE TOP OF A CYLINDRICAL CONCRETE MONUMENT, 12
 CZ0118'INCHES IN DIAMETER, PROJECTING 2 INCHES ABOVE THE SURFACE
 CZ0118'OF THE GROUND.  IT IS 3 FEET NORTH OF A BARREL CACTUS AND
 CZ0118'ABOUT THE SAME ELEVATION AS THE STATION.
 CZ0118'
 CZ0118'A STANDARD BENCH MARK WAS USED FOR THE AZIMUTH MARK.  THE
 CZ0118'DISK, STAMPED E 399 1962, IS SET IN THE TOP OF A CYLINDRICAL
 CZ0118'CONCRETE MONUMENT, 12 INCHES IN DIAMETER, PROJECTING 3 INCHES
 CZ0118'ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND.  IT IS 97.5 FEET WEST OF THE
 CZ0118'CENTER OF U.S. HIGHWAY 80, 42.0 FEET NORTH OF THE CENTER
 CZ0118'OF THE MACADAM SURFACED SIDE ROAD AND CATTLE GUARD, 2.0 FEET
