## Website Summary

My website has a few [android apps](https://bubbajuice.github.io/apps) and a in-depth list of [benchmarks](https://bubbajuice.github.io/benchmarks), each with helpful information and photos to aid finding said benchmark.

## Website Future

My goals for my website are to have tools to aid in converting coordinates into different formats, an in depth list of benchmarks compiled from multiple resources, and in-depth pages for each benchmark I have personally found, along with some of the ones I have not found, but searched for. Progress on benchmarks I have added and not added can be found in [this project](https://github.com/users/BubbaJuice/projects/1/views/1). The benchmarks page will hopefully be able to be sorted by certain fields, (date monumented, date of recovery, condition, etc.)
